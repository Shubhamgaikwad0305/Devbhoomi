# DEVBHOOMI TOURISM
Uttarakhand is well-known as Devbhoomi Uttarakhand because it has two Khands (parts). Kedar Khand and Kurma Khand are the two khands. Manas Khand is another name for Kurma Khand. More people from all over the world visit Devbhoomi Uttarakhand for ceremonial rituals than just about any other state in India.

Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the field') is a Hindu temple roughly 1200 years old[1] dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.

# BADRINATH

The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the First World War, the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple's staff, but the site drew thousands each year and up to 50,000 on its duodecennial festivals (every twelve years).[8] In recent years its popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006 season,[9] compared to 90,676 in 1961.[10] The temple in Badrinath is also a sacred pilgrimage site for Vaishnavites. Badrinath is also gateway to several mountaineering expeditions headed to mountains like Nilkantha.
